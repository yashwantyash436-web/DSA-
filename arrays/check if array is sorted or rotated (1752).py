# 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

# Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, 
# then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

# There may be duplicates in the original array.

# Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that 
# B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.



class Solution:
    def check(self, nums):
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]:
                count += 1

        return count <= 1
